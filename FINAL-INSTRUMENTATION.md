## 🤖 Generation Summary: 10 Parts

The system automatically generates these 10 additional parts:

1. **C Flute 2** ← Clarinet 2 + Trumpet 2 + Alto Sax 2
2. **C Flute 3** ← Clarinet 3 + Trumpet 3 + Alto Sax 3
3. **Oboe** ← C Flute 2 (copy)
4. **Eb Alto Clarinet** ← Eb Alto Sax 3
5. **Bassoon** ← C Trombone 2 (copy)
6. **Eb Baritone Saxophone** ← Bb Bar TC + C Bar BC + Tbn 1 + Tbn 2
7. **Violin** ← C Flute 1 (octave down)
8. **Viola** ← C Flute 3 (octave down)
9. **Cello** ← C Trombone 1 (copy)
10. **Tuba** ← C Baritone BC (octave down)

## 🎵 Musical Relationships

### Same Music (Bb Transposition):
- **Bb Soprano Sax = Bb Clarinet 1 = Bb Trumpet 1**
- **Bb Clarinet 2 = Bb Trumpet 2**
- **Bb Tenor Sax = Bb Clarinet 3 = Bb Trumpet 3**
- **Bb Baritone TC = Bb Bass Clarinet**

All these parts have the **same written notation** because they're all Bb transposing instruments.

### Different Clefs, Different Transpositions:
- **C Baritone BC** (Bass clef, non-transposing)
- **Bb Baritone TC** (Treble clef, transposes down major 2nd)

These are DIFFERENT parts with different transpositions, despite the similar name.
